You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <h1>Projects, Notes and Codes</h1>
    <p>This is a repository of codes/projects/interesting stuffs I've worked on. They span a broad region from quantitative finance, to quantum physics and the casino. Most of them are <em><strong>very basic</strong></em>, and they are written in my free time - just as a note for myself. I hope some netizen will find these code useful. Do drop me an <a href="mailto:kennethkhoo.89@gmail.com">email</a> if you have any comments.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Quantative Finance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Object oriented Monte Carlo framework using Parallel - C#</li>
	</ul>
	  <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance">Monte Carlo</a> methods are widely used in derivative pricing. The underlying process is simple: we assumes the underlying to drift at a risk-free rate, and we simulate possible paths of the underlying. The price of a derivatives is then implied from the paths generated. Monte Carlo simulation are particularly useful to price any derivatives with "Counter" feature, such as a <a href="http://www.fincad.com/resources/resource-library/wiki/range-accrual-notes">Target Range Accrual</a>. In this project I attempt to write a Monte Carlo framework in C#, focusing on (1) making it object oriented, thus reusable for any SDE or products and (2) making it runs in parallel, for the speed. A quick guide is available in this <a href="nowhere">note</a>, and the source code can be found <a href="nowhere">here</a>. As a comparison, we will price an European Option and run a quick comparison.</p>

    <h3>Physics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-Consistent calculation with adaptive boundary condition for electrons in Silicon Nanostructure.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project was done in collaboration with <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geri_Gopir'>Dr G. Gopir</a>. It involves computing the eigenfunction and eigenenergies of electrons in the inversion layer in an n-MOSFET's gate, by solving the Schrodinger and Maxwell equations itteratively. Stable solutions were found with suitable initial guess. The algorithm was further stablized by considering an adaptive boundary condition. The results was subsequently presented in the Regional Conference of Solid State Science and Technology (<a href="http://www.ukm.my/rcssst2011/">RCSSST 2001</a>), and it was <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3igk1safyozjas/GGopir_self_consistent_calculation_with_adaptive_boundary_silicon_nanostructure.pdf?dl=0">published</a> in <em>Solid State Science and Technology</em> <strong>20</strong>:88-95.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Controlling the repulsive Casimir force with optical Kerr effect.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project was done in collaboration with <a href="http://umexpert.um.edu.my/rooi">Prof C.H. Raymond. Ooi</a>. It seeks a theoretical method to control the Casimir force between two parallel plate by varying the intensity of impinging laser. With a good combination of materials, we can see that the Casimir force may be varied between attractive and repulsive, just by changing the intensity of laser. The results were <a href="http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v86/i6/e062509">published</a> in Phys. Rev. A <strong>86</strong>:062509. This project was also presented in the National Conference on Physics (PERFIK 2012), with several results subsequently published in <a href="http://www.ukm.my/jsm/pdf_files/SM-PDF-42-12-2013/17%20Y.Y.%20Khoo.pdf">Sains Malaysiana</a> 42(12)(2013): 1799â€“1803. These results are the basis to my <a href="http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/4785/1/Thesis_-_Khoo_Yee_Yang.pdf">thesis</a>. The (messed up version) of the codes are available on <a href = "https://github.com/yykhoo88/ControllingRepulsiveCasimirForce">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mrirblpdohsunvp/BlackJackSim.py?dl=0">Black Jack Strategy</a> in Python.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This code simulates a BlackJack game. The player strategy is still yet to be coded, but a basic but effective strategy was well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">published</a>. Also I've found an open-source version of blackjack simulator: PowerSim, which uses X-Basic. Here's a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9b1iulzpz8szklf/PowerSim.zip?dl=0">mirror</a> of it.</p>

      <li>Building a <a href='https://www.ethereum.org/'>Ethereum</a> mining rig.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As a tech geek, I'm also being struck with the <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/07/bitcoin-crypto-currencies-mcafee'>blockchain gold rush</a>. Then I decided to build a simple mining rig with 4x GTX1070Ti, capable of squeezing 32Mh per second each. I follow blockchain news pretty closely, especially the <a href='https://www.coinwarz.com/difficulty-charts/ethereum-difficulty-chart'>difficulty of Ethereum</a>!
