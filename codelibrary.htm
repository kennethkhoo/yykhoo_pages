1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math".

You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <h1>Code Repository</h1>
    <p>This is a repository of codes/projects/interesting stuffs I've worked on. They span a broad region from quantative finance, to quantum physics and the casino. Most of them are <em><strong>very basic</strong></em>, and they are written in my free time - just to have a better understanding of everything. I hope some netizen will find these code useful. Do drop me an <a href="mailto:kennethkhoo.89@gmail.com">email</a> if you have any comments!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Quantative Finance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47397655/EuropeanBS.xlsm">Black-Scholes formula for an European Option</a> - in VBA. ToDo: add greeks.</li>
      <li>More to come!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Physics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>*<!-- end .content -->Self-Consistent calculation with adaptive boundary condition for electrons in Silicon Nanostructure.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project was done in my undergraduate year with great help from Dr G. Gopir. It involves computing the eigenfunction and eigenenergies of electrons in the inversion layer in an n-MOSFET's gate, by solving the Schrodinger and Maxwell equations itteratively. Stable solutions were found with suitable initial guess. The algorithm was further stablized by considering an adaptive boundary condition. The results was subsequently presented in the Regional Conference of Solid State Science and Technology (<a href="http://www.ukm.my/rcssst2011/">RCSSST 2001</a>), and it was <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47397655/GGopir_self_consistent_calculation_with_adaptive_boundary_silicon_nanostructure.pdf">published</a> in <em>Solid State Science and Technology</em> <strong>20</strong>:88-95.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>*Controlling the repulsive Casimir force with optical Kerr effect.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project was done in my postgraduate year along with great help from C.H. Raymond. Ooi. It seeks a theoretical method to control the Casimir force between two parallel plate by varying the intensity of impinging laser. With a good combination of materials, we can see that the Casimir force may be varied between attractive and repulsive, just by changing the intensity of laser! The results were <a href="http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v86/i6/e062509">published</a> in Phys. Rev. A <strong>86</strong>:062509. This project was also presented in the National Conference on Physics (PERFIK 2012), with several results subsequently published in <a href="http://www.ukm.my/jsm/pdf_files/SM-PDF-42-12-2013/17%20Y.Y.%20Khoo.pdf">Sains Malaysiana</a> 42(12)(2013): 1799–1803.</p>

    <p>*Some of these codes are not readily shared online. Do get in touch if you want to take a look on the codes. Thanks!    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Others</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47397655/BlackJackSim.py">Black Jack Strategy</a> in Python. This code simulates a BlackJack game. The player strategy is still yet to be coded, but a basic but effective strategy was well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy">published</a>. Also I've found an open-source version of blackjack simulator: PowerSim, which uses X-Basic. Here's a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47397655/PowerSim.zip">mirror</a> of it.      </li>
