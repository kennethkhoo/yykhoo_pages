Some programming hobby. Let's attempt to build a [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) website using [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/). This is an easy tutorial and we should be able to build it in less than 10 minutes.

### Sign Up for Amazon AWS

First of course, head over to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign yourself up! You'll be prompted to give a credit card, but if used right the charges should be minimal.
After that, you'll be prompted with the AWS management console. On the "find services" tab, put in "Amazon Lightsail". You'll be shown the lightsail page.
