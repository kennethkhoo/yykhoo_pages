Hello world! This is the first time I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to write a blog! In fact, I'm so tempted to use the blog as a new platform that I've customized it slightly:
1. Forked this blog from [jekyllnow](https://www.jekyllnow.com/).
2. Added [tags](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/) to the blog.
3. Changed the [structures slightly](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/project-management/jupyter-notebook-on-jekyll/) to make it compatible with [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)!
4. Fixed [double frame bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55308142/why-do-i-get-a-double-frame-around-markdown-code-block-on-jekyll-site).
5. Also read a [style guide](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) for markdown.

That's it! I've created my first markdown, blog aware static page. Cool, huh?
